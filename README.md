# JMetalPy One Zero Problem

## Installation 

This project contains a `requirement.txt` with all required dependencies. You should install them before running the source code. 

### For macOS Users

You have to install a virtual environment before installing all dependencies.

```sh
python3 -m venv __env__
source __env__/bin/activate  
```

Now you can install the requirements


Open the terminal in the same project's folder and run:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running  

If you close the terminal, you have to active the virtual environment again. Use the following command:

```sh
source __env__/bin/activate 
```

If everything is correct, just type the following command in the terminal:


```sh
python3 main.py
```
